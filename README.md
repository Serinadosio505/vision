# Hypothes.is Vision

[Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) will be an open platform for the collaborative evaluation of knowledge.

Our efforts are based on the <a title="Annotator" href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/annotator/">Annotator</a> project and <a title="Open Annotation Data Model" href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">annotation standards</a> for digital documents being developed by the <a href="http://openannotation.org/">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> for the <a title="World Wide Web Consortium" href="http://w3.org/">Web community</a>. We partner broadly with developers, publishers, academic institutions, researchers, and individuals to <a title="Contribute" href="/contribute">develop a platform</a> for the next generation of read-write Web applications.

## Roadmap Repo

We're using this repo for managing the overarching roadmap for our various
projects and ideas concerning open annotation and its implementation.

Anything tagged with the label "Roadmap: Major" will show up on the [hypothes.is/roadmap page.](http://hypothes.is/roadmap)

[Action happens in the Issues of this repo on GitHub.](http://github.com/hypothesis/vision/issues/)
