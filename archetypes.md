User Archetypes
===========

It might be useful for us to have notions of archetypal users of Hypothes.is.  Each of us could play different roles at different times.  Archetypes will have specific objectives and because of those specific requirements, patterns of use and interactions with other counterparties.

This is an incomplete list, with stub descriptions.  Please help complete and refine.

The Student
--------------
Annotates class material both for personal note taking and also for collaborative discussion with other classmates, both for informal benefit, but also as a class requirement.

The Teacher
--------------
Forms groups around classes and class sections where they can follow and respond to the reading, thinking and lesson work of students as they annotate.

The Open Government Advocate
------------------------------------
Works collaboratively with peers to critique, often privately, but sometimes publicly key government documents both publicly available at government websites, but also sourced in other ways and posted via blogs or other ways (Document Cloud, etc)

The Journalist
----------------
Does research for potential stories by privately annotating source material across the web.

The Researcher
------------------
Takes private field notes on ongoing research, and also on related journal articles.  Works collaboratively to co-author papers, through drafting and then submission to journals.  Responds to critique by other authors and reviewers, edits, resolves annotations.  Also may serve as a Reviewer.

The Reviewer
---------------
Provides structured feedback around article submissions.  Does so either once, or in stages according to the review process.  May potentially interact openly or anonymously with other reviewers and authors depending on the style of peer-review and the nature of the publication.

The Editor
------------
Accepts submissions for journal articles, identifies reviewers, coordinates the process of the review.  Sets up and defines the type of review being done (within the guidelines of their publication), and the visibility and permission model of group settings to fit.  Potentially aggregates and harmonizes reviews to provide guidance to authors.  Coordinates with authors on the revision of the article.  Accepts for publication.  Moves to proofing.  Publishes.

The Bookmarker (Web surfer)
---------------------------------
Wants to annotate and tag articles as they surf for personal organization and archiving.

The Redditor
---------------
Wants to see commentary from Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter and other sources folded onto the web wherever they are.  Eventually probably wants to be able to reply to threads in place without having to go back 

The Reader
-------------
Wants to annotate books as a way of reading more critically.  Might want to participate in a book club with others.

The Site- or Content Owner
-------------------------------
Wants to efficiently browse- and filter all annotations regarding to the site/content. Might create “headlights” annotations which are important for all people who had annotated the site/content.

The Information Organizer / Disseminator (individual or organization)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wants to synthesize the information available about a given area of interest, and then present the various bits and pieces it in a more accessible/discoverable format. Does what the researcher does to explore various areas. Reads reports, articles and books, looks for proof supporting/refuting various competing theories. Builds and publishes documents mostly by transcluding (sometimes also translating) the collected data. A large part of the work might turn out to be countering misinformation being spread by ignorant people / adversaries.

The Developer
----------------
Wants to build other annotation services or integrate their applications with annotation. Often they work providing solutions for all of the users archetypes above.
